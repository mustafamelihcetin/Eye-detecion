# Eye Detection System

This is an eye detection system implemented using OpenCV and Haar cascades. The system detects eyes in a video stream from the default camera and draws green rectangles around them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mustafamelihcetin/Eye-detection.git

2. Change into the project directory:

cd Eye-detection

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:

python main.py

This will start the eye detection system and open a window showing the video stream with green rectangles around detected eyes.

2. Press the 'q' key to quit the program.
